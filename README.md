# Wordsmith Client

An AI-powered writing assistant. Highlight the text you wrote on any webpage and get rewritten tet to match your desired tone

> Note: This only contains code for the frontend, you can access the backend here: [Wordsmith Backend](https://github.com/paaatrrrick/wordsmith-api)

## So, what is this?

This is a GPT-powered Chrome extension that helps you write better. When you have signed up, go to any website where you write text, such as an email or LinkedIn posts (currently, I am adding functionality for Google Docs). Highlight any sentence you wrote, then a popup will show up. This will have seven different options on how to rewrite it, including scholarly, professional, and concise. Clicking on them will have GPT rewrite it.
