## So, what is this?

This is a GPT powered chrome extension that helps you write better. When you have signed up, go to any website where you write text, such as an email or linkedin posts (currently I am adding functionality for Google Docs). Highlight the any sentence you wrote than a popup will show up. This will have seven different option on how to rewrite it including scholarly, professional, and concise. Clicking on them will have GPT rewrite it.
